    Concentration camps were made by the Nazis, <br>
    they were small fenced areas where they would use them for forced labor<br>
    and then execute them using gas chambers.<br><br>
    <b>Purpose of Concentration camps:</b><br><br>
    To incarcerate people whom the Nazi regime perceived to be a security threat. <br>
    These people were incarcerated for indefinite amounts of time.<br>
    To eliminate individuals and small, targeted groups of individuals by murder, <br>
    away from the public and judicial review.<br>
    To exploit forced labor of the prisoner population. <br>
    This purpose grew out of a labor shortage.<br>

  What were some of the hardships that people edured while living in a CONCENTRATION camp?</font></b></i></h2><p><font size="5" color="white"><br>
    The majority of those who perished (die) during the Holocaust were <br>
    murdered in the dreadful network of concentration camps by the Nazis. <br>
    Throughout the Holocaust, numerous individuals died as a result of various <br>
    Nazi initiatives, but the Nazi was always looking for new ways to solve the <br>
    Jewish Problem. The Nazi's system of concentration  served as their Final Solution. <br>
Due to the circumstances under which they were kept, including overcrowding, <br>
a lack of running water, heat, food, exhausting and arduous (difficult) labour, <br>
and brutality (cruelty) by Nazi guards, people in concentration camps frequently <br>
perished  from illness, and bad treatment.<br>

    As soon as the people approached at the concentration camp, <br>
    they were separated according to their gender and age group <br>
    and were given prisoner numbers. From this point onwards, <br>
    they would typically only be referred to by this number rather than their names.<br>
     Their numbers were rather stamped into their hands or stitched on the given clothes. <br>
     The given clothes were only striped pajamas with black shoes. <br>
     The prisoners (Jews) were then also told to shave their heads <br>
     and start working on the assigned job.<br>

  The First Concentration Camp</font></b></i></h2><p><font size="5" color="white"><br>
    Nazi Germany's first concentration camp opened on March 22, 1933. <br>
    Communists, social democrats, and other dissidents were among the <br>
    political opponents of Hitler who were supposed to be interned in the camp. <br>
    Prisoners were brought to the camps in a variety of ways, most frequently by rail, <br>
    but occasionally by truck and, in cases when the camps were near by, on foot as well. <br>
    Even though some transports may go on for weeks, the trip to the camps typically took few days. <br>
    On their trip, prisoners were crammed so closely together that it<br>

    On May 9, 1945, the Allies freed it as their final camp. <br>
    Between 63,000 and 65,000 people are said to have perished <br>
    in the Stutthof concentration camp and its subcamps as a consequence <br>
    of murder, malnutrition, diseases, harsh working conditions, <br>
    violent and forced evacuations, and a lack of medical care.<br>

    As the pictures ILLUSTRATE, the Jews were given particular uniforms <br>
    to wear and were FORCED to work in harsh conditions. <br>
    They were SEPARATED from the Germans and did not HAVE freedom <br>
    to do what they wanted too. In the city, German officers also made walls <br>
    from which only Germans were allowed to pass.<br>
